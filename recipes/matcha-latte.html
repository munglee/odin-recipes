    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        A matcha latte is a vibrant green drink made with finely ground matcha green tea powder, combined with steamed
        milk, and often sweetened for a smooth, creamy beverage with a slightly earthy flavor.</p>

        <li>Sweetener (honey, sugar, or agave - optional)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the matcha: In a small bowl, whisk 1-2 teaspoons of matcha powder with a small amount of hot water (about 2 oz) until it becomes a smooth paste. You can use a bamboo whisk for traditional preparation or a regular whisk.</li>
        <li>Steam the milk: Heat and steam your milk until itâ€™s hot and frothy (you can use a frother or steam wand).</li>
        <li>Combine: Pour the steamed milk into the prepared matcha paste, stirring gently to combine.</li>
        <li>Sweeten: Add your desired sweetener (honey or sugar) and stir until dissolved.</li>
